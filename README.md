* Comparative and Computational Music Lab

This code is for conducting perceptual experiments on a 20 song global song sample.

The recordings were take from a Tenzer's 'Analytical and Cross-Cultural Studies of World Music'

We divided the experiment into two parts:

1)Songwise Evaluation
2)Pairwise Comparison

** PART 1

For a our Songwise Evaluation, we ask participants to rate each song on 13 distinct parameters.
The parameters are used to evaluate the aesthetic and stylistic features of songs and are measured on a scale from 0 to 100.

The features are as follows:

1. Texture
        Solo or Multiple Voices
2. Consonance
        Dissonant or Consonant
3. Familiarity
        Unfamiliar or Familiar
4. Rhythm
        Asymmetric Meter or Symmetric Meter
5. Valence
        Negative or Positive
6. Excitement
        No Excitement or Excitement Induced
7. Liking
        Dislike or Like
8. Ornamentation
        No Ornamentation or Significant Ornamentation
9. Grooviness
        No Desire to Move to the Rhythm or Desire to Move to the rhythm
10. Tempo
        Slow or Fast 
11. Pitch
        Low or High
12. Timbre
        Dark or Bright
13. Sound Quality 
        Low or High

** PART 2

We then asked the participants to evaulate all possible pairs of 20 songs in 4 blocks of 47-48 song comparisons each.

For this we asked the participants to evaluate the songs based on Similarity and Preference on a scale from 0 to 100.

The experiment took 2.5 hours with 5 minute breaks between each section but can take up to 3 hours.
